# Introduction to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax. It’s widely used for creating formatted text using a simple syntax that is easy to read and write. This guide will introduce the basics of Markdown, helping you to quickly create content that can be converted into HTML.

## Headers

Headers are used to define the structure of your document. You can create headers by adding `#` symbols before your text.

```markdown
# H1 Header
## H2 Header
### H3 Header
#### H4 Header
```

## Emphasis

To emphasize text, you can use `*` or `_` for *italic* and `**` or `__` for **bold**.

```markdown
*Italic* or _Italic_
**Bold** or __Bold__
```

## Lists

Markdown supports both unordered and ordered lists. Unordered lists use `*`, `+`, or `-`, while ordered lists use numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
* Item 1
* Item 2

1. First
2. Second
```

## Links

You can add hyperlinks by enclosing the link text in square brackets `[]`, followed by the URL in parentheses `()`.

```markdown

```

## Images

Adding images is similar to adding links, but with an exclamation mark `!` at the beginning.

```markdown
![Alt text](image-url.png)
```

## Code Blocks

For inline code, enclose text with backticks `` ` ``. For multi-line code blocks, use triple backticks.

```markdown
`Inline code`

```
Multiline
code block
```
```

## Blockquotes

To create blockquotes, use the `>` symbol.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Horizontal Rules

You can create a horizontal rule using three or more hyphens `-`, asterisks `*`, or underscores `_`.

```markdown
---
```

## Tables

Tables are created using pipes `|` and hyphens `-` to separate columns and headers.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   |
| Row 2    | Data 2   |
```

## Conclusion

Markdown is a simple yet powerful tool for creating formatted text. It’s perfect for writing content that is easy to convert to HTML or other formats. By mastering these basics, you’ll be able to create well-structured documents with minimal effort.
