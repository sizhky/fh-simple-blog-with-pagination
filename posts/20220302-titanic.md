# The Construction of the Titanic

The RMS Titanic, one of the most famous ships in history, was constructed by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The construction began in 1909 and took about three years to complete, finishing in 1912.

## Design and Ambition

The Titanic was designed to be the largest and most luxurious passenger liner of its time. It measured 882 feet in length, weighed over 46,000 tons, and had a capacity for over 2,200 passengers and crew. The ship was part of a trio of Olympic-class liners commissioned by the White Star Line to dominate the transatlantic passenger market.

## Building the Ship

The construction involved over 3,000 workers, who toiled day and night to bring the Titanic to life. The ship’s hull was made of steel plates, riveted together by hand, a labor-intensive process. Inside, the Titanic boasted grand staircases, opulent dining rooms, and lavish cabins, epitomizing the height of Edwardian luxury.

## Technological Marvel

The Titanic was equipped with advanced technologies for its time, including watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors. Despite these innovations, the ship’s safety features were insufficient, a fact tragically revealed during its maiden voyage.

## Launch and Legacy

The Titanic was launched on May 31, 1911, and after sea trials, it departed on its maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. Unfortunately, it struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912, and sank, leading to the loss of over 1,500 lives. The construction and subsequent sinking of the Titanic have left an indelible mark on history, symbolizing both human ingenuity and the limits of technology.
